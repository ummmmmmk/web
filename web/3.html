Thank you for your interest in supporting the Wikimedia Foundation. We are not
 fundraising in your country at this time, but monetary contributions are not
  your only option for donating to and supporting Wikipedia.

Wikipedia is a "wiki", which means that everyone can edit pages. You don't need
to apply or get special permission to join us. At the top of each page is an
"edit" label. Try it, for example, at the Wikipedia sandbox. You don't even need
to log in to edit, although creating an account gives you more options and helps
 you keep track of your contributions. There is no central editorial board; all
  edits are made by individual members of the Wikipedia community. For more
  information, please see the introduction and tutorial.
If you have any further questions regarding Wikipedia or editing, please contact
 info@wikimedia.org. This email address is answered by longtime project
 participants who have vast experience in Wikipedia-related issues.

Thanks again for your interest, and we hope you join us!
