History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to
examine and analyse a sequence of past events,
and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.
 Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its
usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as
a way of providing "perspective" on the problems of the present.
Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources
(such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually
 classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the
 "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.
